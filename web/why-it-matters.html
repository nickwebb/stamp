            <h2>The Music Industry Is Broken</h2>
            <p>For too long, the music industry has operated on a model that extracts value from artists rather than empowering them. The rise of streaming platforms initially promised democratization but has instead created new gatekeepers and economic challenges for creators.</p>

                    <h3>Unsustainable Economics</h3>
                    <p>Most musicians can't earn a living wage from their art in the current streaming economy. With payouts averaging fractions of a penny per stream, artists need millions of plays just to earn minimum wage. This system forces creators to prioritize quantity over quality and chase viral trends rather than developing their artistic vision.</p>

                <div class="problem-content">
                    <h3>Algorithmic Gatekeeping</h3>
                    <p>Black-box algorithms now determine which artists get discovered and which remain in obscurity. These systems are designed to maximize platform profits, not to support artistic merit or diversity. The result is a homogenization of music and fewer opportunities for innovative or niche artists to find their audience.</p>

                    <h3>Disconnected Communities</h3>
                    <p>The direct connection between artists and fans has been severed by intermediaries who control access and communication. Platforms own the relationship with listeners, leaving artists with little insight into their audience and few ways to build sustainable communities around their work.</p>

                    <h3>Data Opacity</h3>
                    <p>Artists have limited access to crucial data about who's listening to their music, where their fans are located, and how they're engaging. This information asymmetry makes it difficult to plan tours, target marketing efforts, or understand audience preferences.</p>
