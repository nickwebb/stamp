        <h2>The Streaming Problem</h2>
        
        <div class="problem-section">
            <h3>The Current Model is Broken</h3>
            <p>Currently artists pay to make their music and give it to the streaming services for free. Then are paid a fraction of a pence/cent per listen. We love Spotify as a listener but for artists the streaming model is broken and disheartening.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem-section">
            <h3>Early Fans Matter</h3>
            <p>Early fans should be rewarded. There has been no benefit to being an early discoverer of a new artist. We want that to change, to incentivise those early fans that are so helpful to artists. Money aside, early fans keep new artists going and give important feedback.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem-section">
            <h3>A Better Way Forward</h3>
            <p>Not everyone can make a career as an artist, but it is possible for artists to earn more. How? Give early fans exclusive access - to b-sides, demos, songs, DAW project files, live gigs, chat etc etc. The artist decides how much they want to charge and for what.</p>
            
            <div class="stamp-value">
                <div class="stamp-price">
                    <span class="price">$10</span>
                    <span class="label">per Stamp</span>
                </div>
                <div class="artist-share">
                    <span class="percentage">90%</span>
                    <span class="label">goes to artist</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>That would take 4,000 streams for an artist to make. So say 12,000 minutes or 200 hours of listening. You'd probably be flagged as a bot if you listened that much.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem-section">
            <h3>Even Success Has Its Challenges</h3>
            <p>Artists that do successfully build a following or get signed find they are still up against it. Even with millions of followers on social media the artists message only goes out if enough people like it, and that doesn't work eg for ticket sales for particular cities. The artist isn't in control of what their fans see, and the fans aren't in control of what they want to see.</p>
            <p>The signed artists find they are subsidising the label. They're lucky if they get 20% of their streaming revenue before costs.</p>

                <h3>Why Does It Matter?</h3>
                <p>Have you noticed there are very few new bands in the charts any more? That's because the economics don't work well at all. The Beatles, Oasis, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin of today don't exist because they can't. We don't realise what we're losing.</p>
